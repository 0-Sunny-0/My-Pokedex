## My Process

### Built With

- VS Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Webkit
- PokeAPI

### Focus of Learning

- My main focus for this project was practicing my JavaScript functions, specifically fetch calls for api's, async and await, and understanding how to fix JS errors that show in the console through trial and error.

### Continued Development

Currently, there is one error showing in the console, so I'll be working on that to resolve.
